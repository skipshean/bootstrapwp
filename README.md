BootstrapWP
===========

This is a starter theme based on `_s` and Twitter's Bootstrap.

I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as is right out of the box. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.

My ultra-minimal CSS might make me look like theme tartare but that means less stuff to get in your way when you're designing your awesome theme. Here are some of the other more interesting things you'll find here:

* A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
* A helpful 404 template.
* Custom template tags in `inc/template-tags.php` that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.
* Some small tweaks in `inc/extras.php` that can improve your theming experience.
* 2 sample CSS layouts in `layouts/` for a sidebar on either side of your content.
* Smartly organized starter CSS in `style.css` that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.
* Isotope and ImagesLoaded JS incorporated in a Portfolio Custom Post Type to show something custom and slick
* Licensed under GPLv2 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.

Getting Started
---------------

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Good luck!
